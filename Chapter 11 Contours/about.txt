OpenCV provides methods to find “curves” in an image,
called contours. A contour is a curve of points, with no
gaps in the curve. Contours are extremely useful for such
things as shape approximation and analysis.
In order to find contours in an image, you need to first obtain a binarization of the image, using either edge detection
methods or thresholding
